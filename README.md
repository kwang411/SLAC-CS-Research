BatchNorm, with and without.pdf - Trains semantic segmentation classifer of U-Net + Resnet architecture with and without batch normalization. Displays the loss/error curves for some number of trials.

mnist.py - Practice using Keras framework on top of TensorFlow to classify MNIST dataset. Extract weight matrices and apply Singular Value Decomposition.

mnist_compare.py - Trains MNIST classifer 10 times and logs the loss for each.

scratch.py - Calculates a squared difference matrix of training loss based on mnist_compare.py

svd.py - Loads weights of a model and calculates the singular value decomposition.
