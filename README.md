BatchNorm, with and without.pdf - Presents the results of U-ResNet.py. Displays the loss/error curves for some number of trials for both batch norm and no batch norm.

mnist.py - Practice using Keras framework on top of TensorFlow to classify MNIST dataset. Extract weight matrices and apply Singular Value Decomposition.

mnist_compare.py - Trains MNIST classifer 10 times and logs the loss for each.

scratch.py - Calculates a squared difference matrix of training loss based on mnist_compare.py

svd.py - Loads weights of a model and calculates the singular value decomposition.

U-ResNet.py - Trains semantic segmentation classifer of U-Net + Resnet architecture with and without batch normalization.
